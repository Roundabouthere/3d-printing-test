# Installing Rhino3d

To install Rhino you can download it from the official page here:

It will ask you for a licence, unfortunately the university only has a licence for Architecture Building and Planning at the moment but you can use a temporary email to sign up which will give you access for 90 days. After that 90 days is up you can get a updated licence with another email.

I use a temporary email address each time that I need to renew and that seems to work just fine. You can get one from sites like this one: [https://temp-mail.org/en/](https://temp-mail.org/en/)
