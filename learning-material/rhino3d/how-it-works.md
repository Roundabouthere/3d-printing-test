# How it works

### For an introduction to using Rhino3d sign up to our next training on eventbrite here: [http://go.unimelb.edu.au/tx3r](http://go.unimelb.edu.au/tx3r)

To get you started using Rhino3d are going to break it down to learning 3 easy steps:

#### 1. Drawing a shape

There are essentially two ways to do this. The first is to **Free Draw** a shape or to use a **Predetermind Shape.**

#### 2. Trimming and joining shapes

Trimming and joining shapes with a command called **Boolean**. This command works best on shapes that intersect each other completely.
