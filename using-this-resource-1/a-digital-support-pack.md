Normally forntightly workshops and project orientated meetups are offered in person at the Melbourne Univiersity campus. However, we have created Digital Support Packs for researchers in response to Covid-19 to continue to provide our services.

This Digital Support Pack is intended as a resource to help students learn new digital tools and skills online. At Research Computing Services, we coordinate communities for a wide variety of digital tools for researchers.

Specifically this Digital Support Pack will introduce you to options for using 3d data for your research, including computer aided design programs. This support pack is split into several modules which can be completed either as a self-paced self-learning lab, or with the facilitation of a trainer via webinar software such as Zoom.
