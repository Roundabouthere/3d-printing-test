# 3d Printing

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/zpAdcIJmX\_k" caption="How 3d printing can help your research!" %}

The **3D printing** process builds a three-dimensional object from a computer aided design \(CAD\) model, usually by successively adding material layer by layer, which is why it is also called **additive manufacturing**.The term "3D printing" covers a variety of processes in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together typically layer by layer.  
  
The NExTLAB of Melbourne Universities school of design maintains a excellent gitbook on 3d printing tips [here](https://msd-makerspaces.gitbook.io/next-lab/3d-printing/3d-printing-at-the-next-lab).
