# 3d Scanning

![A fragile pot is scanned for analysis that would otherwise be impossible.](../.gitbook/assets/pot.gif)

**3D scanning** is the process of analysing a real-world object or environment to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance \(e.g. colour\). The collected data can then be used to construct digital 3D models.  
  
The NExTLAB of Melbourne Universities school of design maintains a excellent gitbook on 3d scanning tools for Lidar, photogrammertry and associated software [here](https://msd-makerspaces.gitbook.io/next-lab/3d-scanning/software).
