# Why are researchers using 3d Data?

#### So why are researchers using 3d data? 

Mostly because they are working with something physical and you want to create a mathematical representation of it. Its a simplistic answer, but there is a wide range of applications and reasons for doing this. It could be to make an analysis, a representation for pedagogical reasons or to render a form from data, the list goes on.

For the purposes of these trainings it is more useful to think about what _you_ would like to do with 3d data and then hopefully find the best tool for you to do it. For example, in 2019 we challenged groups of researchers in a hackathon to develop innovative medical devices using 3d data and 3d printing.
