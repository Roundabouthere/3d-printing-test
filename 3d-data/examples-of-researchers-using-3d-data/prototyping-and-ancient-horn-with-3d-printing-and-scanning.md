This is a great example from Billy Ó Foghlú is a PhD student studying archaeology at the Australian National University \(ANU\).

After 3D printing a replica of a Bronze Age artefact, long believed to be a spear butt, he uncovered evidence that it was actually a mouthpiece from an ancient Irish horn.

So he took a scan of the instrument and 3d printed it, which is what you see in these images.
