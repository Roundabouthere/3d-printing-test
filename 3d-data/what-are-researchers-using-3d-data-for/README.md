# What are Researchers using 3d Data for?

#### Research methods and skills

Learning to work efficiently with 3D data allows researchers to develop and enhance fundamental research methods. Research methods are the systematic tools used to find, collect, analyse and interpret information, the methods by which you conduct research into a subject or a topic. You can read more about resarch methods [here](https://methods.sagepub.com/methods-map/mixed-methods). The two main research methods that benefit from 3d data are Data Visualisation and Prototyping. For the purposes of introducing 3d Data, think about how learning to work efficiently with 3D data allows researchers to develop and enhance those fundamental research methods.
