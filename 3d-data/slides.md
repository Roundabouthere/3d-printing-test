  Defining 3d Data for researchers and what benefits it can bring to you and
  your research.

# \*master text from slides

### Put simply **3d Data** is o**bject based data, it** is a mathematical representation of something three dimensional. 

For the purposes of establishing a broad ecology of tools with which to handle your research data, we are going to be working with 3d Data under this very broad definition. It could take the form of 3d Scans, a 3d design created with Computer Aided Design, a 3d print or even raw number sets.

_The physical to digital examples here_

What we are going to be talking about to is not so much how you can record your data, but more about how you can handle your data and what benefits that can bring to your research.

#### So why are researchers using 3d data? 

_\(rephrase as a intro as a story example/researcher profile - one that saves time, or makes a more effective workflow for including 3d data\)_ 

Because you are working with something physical and you want to create a mathematical representation of it. There’s a wide range of reasons for doing this, and a wide range of applicationse

research methods and skills

research methods are the systematic tools used to find, collect, analyse and interpret information, the methods by which you conduct research into a subject or a topic.

But for the purposes of introducing 3d Data, I want you to think about how learning to work efficiently with 3D data allows researchers to develop and enhance fundamental research methods.

8

Data visualisation

document, share, collaborate, communicate, teach, allow reproducible research

The two main research methods that benefit from 3d data are Data visualisation.  
The examples you see here are examples of 3D scanning, photogrammetry, 3D rendering

Prototyping

experimental methods, iteration, fail fast to succeed faster

Billy Ó Foghlú from the National Australian University

Irish horn from the Bronze Age

And prototyping.  
This is a great example from Billy Ó Foghlú is a PhD student studying archaeology at the Australian National University \(ANU\).

After 3D printing a replica of a Bronze Age artefact, long believed to be a spear butt, he uncovered evidence that it was actually a mouthpiece from an ancient Irish horn.

So he took a scan of the instrument and 3d printed it, which is what you see in these images.

What are the digital tools

available for

working with 3d data?

So what is 3d data? its Object based data.

11

Digital tools that work with 3D data

For visualisation, analysis and physical output

python

Here are some useful ones - but you’re working with a data set. So, this is like listing all the different things you can count with a number. More useful way to think about this is to consider your outcome and use the tools that you need to get you there. Today we are going to focus on Rhino, because…

12

Rhinoceros 3d

in many workflows a CAD program will be required. And of the selection of CAD programs that are available Rhino is located in the centre of an ecology of tools that will help you with your 3d data. It is a industry standard because....

13

it is regarded as a highend Design tool that is precise, detailed and because people love to present it as one thing specifically – and that is complicated.

14

RHINO

It doesn’t have to be. Today we are going to be treating it as a DIY tool. We are going to be making it work for us, and not the other way around.

This training is going to give you the basics to approach what can be a intimidating, and counterintuitive program. And hopefully then you will have some keys to open up possibilities with your 3d data.

15

What are we doing to do today?

So how are we going to do that?

16

Drawing shapes

Trimming shapes

we are going to break it down to learning two things.  
how to draw a shape

and how to trim a shape

17

LIAM AND ERIC DEMO

HERE

some of these things that you are going to be learning will be specific to rhino, but many more will also be transferable to other 3d tools.

But keep in mind also, that the main thing that we are developing here is the research methodology to push your research.

Some issues with the pitch so far:

‘3d data analysis’ is too broad a title to create a training around Rhino. If I came to that training I would not be expecting a introduction class to using rhino that will highlight the capabilities of rhino for 3d printing?

 -workshop with feedback from pitch for better title?

How does teaching this tool create space to explore the other uses of ‘3d data’? If Rhino is being positioned as a CAD tool at the centre of an ecology of 3d data tools, how am I going to teach those other tools? And how am I going to introduce them to learners?

targeted specific trainings? Meetups?

So how are researchers using 3d printing?
